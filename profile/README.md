# About SaveSync

SaveSync is a student-developed application designed to make data backup and restoration a breeze. We prioritize user-friendliness and functionality, aiming to be the perfect tool for anyone who needs a straightforward way to protect their valuable files.

## Our Goals

- **Learning Through Development:** As a student project, SaveSync is a platform for us to learn and apply concepts of software development, data management, and user interface design.
- **Creating a Usable Tool:** We strive to build a genuinely useful application for basic backup and restore tasks, focusing on simplicity and reliability.

## SaveSync Features

- **Secure Communication:** Connect to the server via SSL sockets, ensuring all data transfers are encrypted and protected.
- **Selective Server Backup:**
  - Browse and select specific folders on the server for backup.
  - Choose individual files within folders for targeted backups.
- **Restore from Backups:** Easily retrieve previous backups and restore your data when needed.
- **Advanced Version Management:**
  - Manage and track different backup versions.
  - Restore specific versions of your data for granular control (depending on application features).
- **Automatic Backups:** Schedule automatic backups of selected folders at regular intervals.
  - This ensures your data is always protected without needing to remember to back up manually.
